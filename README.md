# SustitutionElbowMethod
Method to determine the number of clusters to make a cluster model. It is useful when the information is very large because it is not a graphical method. 

# when we want to know the correct number of cluster before doing a clustering model, maybe k-means, we always use graphic method like elbow graph. 
This has some problems, the first one is when the dataset is huge, is too dificult to any software we are using to make a correct graph.
